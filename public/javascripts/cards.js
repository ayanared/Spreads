      about trying to decide between two men or two woman. It also reflects our values, 
      because our choices mirror back to us the kind of person we wish to become. Here 
      is the problem of free will versus the compulsions of the instincts. Without 
      passing through this initiation by fire, we cannot understand how we create our 
      own future. It is the encounter with feelings, love and beauty, passion and 
      faithfulness, the harmony, uniting of differences. It represents the creation

        This victory is a combination of physical, intellectual and spiritual powers 
        and reflects the potential for both good and evil. On an inner level, the 
        chariot is an image of the aggressive instincts guided and directed by the
         will of consciousness. It means to face the anger and conflict which he has 
         invoked with his desire to possess a beautiful object, the choice of his love.

       and self-discipline of totally egocentric beginnings of a unique individuality. 
       It's the 'me first drive' which will happily destroy anyone or anything in its 
       path, so long as one's own gratification is assured. This lesson of harnessing 
       one's aggression and directing it toward a creative end. Will courage pride and 
       labor, going for it for the lust of life. Strength applied to joyful purpose. 
       Through such an experience we come in contact with the beast but also with the 
       hero, emerging from this contest with trust in oneself and integrity towards 
       others. The lion within is the image of the infantile savage and royalty, 
       interpreted as vigor.

      cardDescription: `The Hermit symbolizes the time for meditation, for looking inward bringing light into 
      darkness, the unconscious, watching the dreams. Here we have loneliness, active 
      or passive isolation to connect the higher spiritual self - a communication 
      between spiritual heaven and material earth. A wise leader, finding one's own 
      light, bringing things to completion, time to harvest, the fruitfulness. We 
      only can reach this maturity with caution and patience, with readiness to 
      reflect upon the 'dark side of the moon'. There is an opportunity to build 
      solid foundations if one is willing to wait. Finally there is a deep respect

      self-realization, the personal destiny. Whirling energies and the effect of 
      the incalculable factor brings the hazard, something new, we call it fate. It 
      can be a sudden change of fortune that overturns the established pattern of life. 
      This is part of the unconscious personality and we only become aware of them 
      through their outward effects, which feel like fate, yet which spring not from 
      some external power but from within the depths of the soul. The wheel is constantly 
      moving, but the center is unchanging - essence of source.

      capacity to make choices based upon reflection, holding the instincts in control.
       The willingness to battle for principles rather than passions, not influenced 
       by personal desire. The necessity of building one's own character, which helps 
       to deal with the great range of life's experiences. Justice is not possible unless 
       we respect fairness and truth as important ethical principles rather than a nice 
       behavior which we adopt because we want to be liked by others. Honesty, balance, 
       order and organization are necessary for decisions and the real power, which comes 
       from insight.

      cardDescription: `The Death card represents an ending. Every end is a transformation, 
      a release, a renewal and purification, an opportunity for a new life, if one can 
      let go of the old one. Whether or not this experience is painful depends upon the 
      person's capacity to accept and recognize the necessity of endings. It is an inner 
      change, the ability to regenerate and the key to hidden wisdom. Death and rebirth 
      for an unknown future.

    of life has died at the same time that a new thing has been born.`

      A quantum leap, a bridge between heaven and earth inviting the polar opposites, 
      the creative forces of masculine and feminine, conscious and unconscious, 
      the sun and the moon., fire and water. Connected with the function of feeling, 
      the active, intelligent faculty of choice, a constantly changing bridge between 
      these opposites, a careful sensing of the needs of a particular situation with 
      the goal of harmony and relationship, balance and tolerance at the end.

       obscure unrestrained energy, obsession, superstition. He is ugly, amoral and crude,
        has dirty and wicked fantasies and is goatish, hairy and inferior. To release the 
        creative power one must free oneself by gaining knowledge and honest, dropping the 
        chains of panic and self-disgust, facing the own darkness. One must learn to confront 
        with humility, the basest and most shameful aspects, otherwise one remains forever

      from the unconscious, stronger than the will's efforts to repress it, collapse 
      of old forms, inner and outer structure, of false or outgrown values, masks, 
      costumes in a play to impress the audience, structures we build in the outside 
      world to embody our incomplete selves. The tower represents achievement, authority 
      and protection is now in a state of breakdown and dissolution. Let go of fear and 
      the survival instinct to face the unknown implies the fall, ruin, punishment and loss,
    imprisonment and danger. But it also means freedom from stagnation and restriction - 
    a spiritual healing force. This break-through will result in changes occurring in outer life.

       The moon is seen full only when 
       it is in exact opposition to the sun. It represents the feminine, feelings and 
       the unconscious. It is elusive and fluctuating. This concealment is the end of 
       karma and it represents passivity, a progression in deepening understanding 
       and experience of the world of dreams and images. It is a meeting with a 
       transpersonal world, where individual boundaries dissolve and the sense of 
       direction and ego are lost. A rebirth in the waters of a greater womb, dimly 
       aware that the journey of personal development is only a small fragment of a

       and female melt, integrate within the individuality with it's potential of
