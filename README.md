## Background
As a tarot lover, I wanted to create an app that gave readings as well as saved layouts that I use or want to use in the future.

## Technologies
Node was used for the backend and a few Javascript files with jQuery were used to do the reading functinality of the cards and automatically populate the date.  The card descriptions and images were found here: [http://freeware.esoterica.free.fr/html/freecards.html#ta](http://freeware.esoterica.free.fr/html/freecards.html#ta)

* Express
* Handlebars
* Mongo/Mongoose
* body-parser
